V1.1
1. "Load Previous" is not working. In "Target Role(s) (separate by ';')". It should fetch the job title from the previous fetch job.
2. It is not following: "Limit per Role & Platform" numbers. Just blindly applying on jobs for same title. Until user closes it. For example: I gave him 3 job titles: "Data Analyst, Business Analyst and Digital Transformation" and 1 in limit per role & platform. It should apply 1 job for each role for each platform. Which will result in the end like applying 3 job titles x 2 platforms = 6 job application.
3.1 Key point to note here: It should count 1 only when it has applied on the job.
4. After the job application loop is done. It should save the job details just like it saves the details when scraping job is initiated.

V1.2
1. When it stucks on any question: It should ask user to input the answer. And once user inputs the answer the bot should automatically update it questions and answers json.
